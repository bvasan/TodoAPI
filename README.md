# TodoAPI
Node.js TodoAPI using Google App Engine and Google Cloud Datastore.

Based on the "The Completed Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition) by Andrew Mead".

The courses uses MongoDB and Heroku. I have refactored the node.js todoAPI sample code to use Google App Engine and Google Cloud Datastore.
